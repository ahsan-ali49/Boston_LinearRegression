# Boston_LinearRegression

Linear regression analysis of the Boston Housing Dataset using Python and scikit-learn. The data is shuffled 10 times with different seeds and split into 70% training and 30% testing. Mean squared error and regression score are plotted to evaluate model performance. Code and data included for reference.

## Boston Housing Dataset Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing the Boston Housing Dataset using linear regression. The analysis is performed by shuffling the data 10 times with different seeds and splitting it into 70% training and 30% testing. The mean squared error (MSE) and regression score are plotted for each shuffle to evaluate the performance of the linear regression model.

The code is written in Python and uses scikit-learn for implementing linear regression and shuffling the data. The dataset is included in the repository and is loaded using pandas. The analysis is performed in Spyder, an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python.

The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate how to perform linear regression on a real-world dataset and evaluate the performance of the model using MSE and regression score. The code and data can be used as a reference for similar analysis on other datasets.

To run the analysis, simply clone the repository and open the boston_linear_regression.py file in Spyder. The file includes detailed explanations of the code and the analysis results.
